# Movie App

Movie App is an Android application that demonstrates the implementation of modern Android development practices, including MVVM architecture, Coroutine for asynchronous programming, Hilt for dependency injection, Coil for image loading, RecyclerView with Adapter for efficient UI display, Retrofit for network communication, and the Repository pattern for data management. The entire project is written in Kotlin, taking advantage of its concise syntax and powerful features.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
  
- **Coroutine**: Utilizes Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming, providing a concise and efficient way to handle background tasks.

- **Hilt**: Integrates Hilt for dependency injection, making the codebase more modular, scalable, and testable.

- **Coil**: Implements Coil for image loading, offering a fast and efficient image loading library for Android.

- **RecyclerView + Adapter**: Utilizes RecyclerView and Adapter pattern for smooth and optimized handling of lists, enhancing the user experience.

- **Retrofit**: Incorporates Retrofit for network communication, enabling seamless interaction with the TVMaze open API.

- **Repository Pattern**: Adopts the Repository pattern to abstract the data layer, promoting a clean and organized structure for managing data.

- **Kotlin**: Entirely written in Kotlin, taking advantage of its modern features, expressiveness, and conciseness.

## API Integration

The app consumes movie data from the TVMaze open API. The API documentation can be found [here](https://www.tvmaze.com/api), providing details on how to retrieve relevant movie information.
